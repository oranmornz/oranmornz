## Hello, I am Oliver.

Welcome to my GitHub. Here you will find small examples of, at this stage, work undertaken during the course of my time recently spent at Dev Academy Aotearoa.

You will also find an example of previous work undertaken with a creative collaborator, and a work-in-progress 'proving ground' of sorts for me to experiment with various things, such as implementations of mathematical expressions, and audio libraries.

With DevAcademy, we learned primarily JavaScript/TypeScript and the usage and implementations of React, Knex/SQLite, Express.js, and other contemporary web development tool sets. For my own projects going forward, although I will be continuing to utilise these tools, I will be gradually working towards proficiency in C##, in pursuit of my overaching goal of developing DSP tools and software.

If desired, I may be contacted via:
